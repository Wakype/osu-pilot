## ‚ú® Key Features

| Feature                 | Description                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Mechanism** | Works by reading `.osu` files. **Does not read game memory or modify files.** |
| **Human-like Aim** | A layered system with curved paths, natural jitter, and an optional "Flow Aim" mode for realistic movement.       |
| **Zero Setup Required** | Auto-detects your Songs folder and saves your calibration. No manual config needed.                           |
| **Mod Support** | Supports HR, DT, and NC, which can be toggled directly from the overlay.                                      |
| **In-Game Overlay** | Shows bot status, map info, and has toggles for mods and aim style. You can also drag it around.             |
| **Hotkey Control** | Start, stop, and hide the overlay with simple hotkeys without leaving the game.                               |

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The bot operates in a clear, sequential lifecycle:

| State            | Description                                                                                                                                                       |
| :--------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **IDLE** | Waits for you to select a beatmap in osu!. It constantly scans the active window's title.                                                                           |
| **DETECT & PARSE** | Once a beatmap is chosen, the title changes. The bot uses this title to find the exact `.osu` file in your `Songs` folder and parses all its data.                  |
| **ARMED** | The overlay updates with the beatmap info, and the bot is now "armed". It waits for you to press `q` to signal the start of the map. This keypress is crucial for synchronization. |
| **EXECUTE** | After syncing, the bot takes full control. It follows the parsed object data with precise timing, moving the cursor and pressing keys until the song ends or you press `Esc`. |
| **RESET** | Once the map is finished or stopped, the bot returns to the `IDLE` state, ready for the next map.                                                                   |
